### Description

This is a FUN platform game based loosely on South Park.

It contains a lot of graphical API use.

The code is not particularly neat, but the game is pretty good considering it's in VB6. I also turned it into a macro (i.e. made it work in VBA) but that is a different story. Huge thanks go to dark phoenix, who did the graphics (mostly from scratch in nothing but MSPaint!). Let me know of any bugs, although I know of a few already.
